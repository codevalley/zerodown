# Corporate Website Redesign

## Project Overview

Acme Corporation approached me to redesign their outdated website. The goal was to create a modern, responsive website that would better represent their brand and improve user engagement.

## Challenge

The existing website had several issues:
- Outdated design that didn't reflect the company's innovative approach
- Poor mobile experience with non-responsive layouts
- Confusing navigation and information architecture
- Slow loading times due to unoptimized assets

## Solution

I worked closely with the Acme team to develop a comprehensive redesign strategy:

1. **Research & Planning**
   - Conducted user interviews and created personas
   - Analyzed competitor websites
   - Defined key user journeys and site objectives

2. **Design**
   - Created wireframes and prototypes
   - Developed a modern visual design system
   - Designed responsive layouts for all device sizes

3. **Development**
   - Built a custom WordPress theme
   - Optimized for performance and SEO
   - Implemented responsive images and lazy loading

4. **Testing & Launch**
   - Conducted usability testing
   - Performed cross-browser and device testing
   - Implemented analytics tracking

## Results

The redesigned website launched successfully with impressive results:
- 45% increase in time spent on site
- 60% reduction in bounce rate
- 30% increase in mobile conversions
- Positive feedback from users and stakeholders

## Technologies Used

- Figma for design and prototyping
- HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS), JavaScript
- WordPress CMS
- PHP
- Webpack for asset bundling
- Google Analytics
