title: Hello, I'm Narayan
---

I have dedicated my life to make myself irrelevant everyday, while staying consistent with the process. So far, it I have managed to make good progress. 

Today, I believe the purpose of my life (or any life) is to improve, efficiency, efficacy and impact of thoughts and actions. I have lived a series of previous lives, including a few where I identify myself as an entrepreneur, designer, engineer, product creator, artist etc. while I carry a piece of each with me today, I find my core purpose in using these tools to improve my system of thinking.

I have a bent for building things, physical and digital. It is my preferred way of problem solving.  

# A few more bits and pieces

- I have been writing code for over 30 years, but only recently started keeping them public on my github. 
- I found signficant joy running my startup *Dexetra*, in my early 20s which crafted some really beautiful and technical mobile first products. 
- My old and unmaintained dribbble. 
- Some really old tracks maintained on soundcloud.
