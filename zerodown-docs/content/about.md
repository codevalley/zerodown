# About Zerodown

## Project Philosophy

Zerodown was built with a simple philosophy in mind: **content should be the priority**. 

Too many static site generators require extensive configuration, complex templating languages, or Javascript frameworks that get in the way of what really matters—your content. Zerodown takes a different approach:

1. **Markdown First**: Write in the format that's become the standard for documentation and content across the web.
2. **Zero Configuration**: Works right out of the box with sensible defaults.
3. **Minimalism**: Does one thing well—transforms your Markdown content into beautiful, semantic HTML.
4. **Speed**: Blazing-fast build times so you can iterate quickly.
5. **Extensibility**: Simple plugin architecture for when you need to extend functionality.
