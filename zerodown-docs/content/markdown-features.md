# Markdown Features

Zerodown leverages standard Markdown syntax and extends it with useful features like front matter for metadata and shortcodes for dynamic content.

## Front Matter

Each Markdown file (`.md`) can optionally start with a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) front matter block enclosed by triple dashes (`---`). This block defines metadata for the page.

```yaml
---
title: "My Awesome Post"                # Page title (used in templates, <title> tag)
date: 2024-04-09                    # Publication date (useful for sorting)
description: "A brief summary of this post." # Page description (used for meta tags)
author: "Jane Doe"                      # Optional author name
image: "/assets/images/hero.jpg"      # Optional featured image path (relative to content dir)
featured: true                      # Custom flag (e.g., for highlighting)
tags: ["python", "static site"]        # Custom list of tags
template: "custom-post.html"          # Optional: Override default template for this page
---

# Your Markdown Content Starts Here

Regular Markdown content follows the front matter block.
```

This metadata is accessible within Jinja templates (e.g., `{{ title }}`, `{{ date }}`) and can be used for sorting, filtering, and displaying page-specific information.

## Links and Images

Use standard Markdown syntax for creating links and embedding images.

```markdown
# Link to another Markdown page within your site
[Read the Getting Started guide](getting-started.md)

# Link to an external website
[Visit PicoCSS](https://picocss.com)

# Embed an image from your assets directory
![Diagram showing Zerodown flow](../assets/diagram.png)
```

**Important:** Zerodown automatically processes relative paths in links (`href`) and image sources (`src`) to ensure they work correctly in the final built site, regardless of how deeply nested your content files are. You should generally use paths relative to the current Markdown file.

### Image Dimensions (Special Syntax)

You can optionally specify image `width` and/or `height` directly in the image alt text using curly braces `{}`:

```markdown
![Logo {width=100 height=50}](../assets/logo.png)
![Thumbnail {width=150}](../assets/thumb.jpg) 
```

This adds `width="..."` and `height="..."` attributes to the generated `<img>` tag. If dimensions aren't specified, Pico.css provides sensible responsive defaults.

## Shortcodes

Shortcodes allow you to embed dynamic content or complex HTML generated by Python functions directly into your Markdown.

They use a simple bracket syntax: `[shortcode_name argument="value"]`

```markdown
## Latest Blog Posts

Here are the latest posts:
[latest_posts count="5" section="blog"] 

## Explore Our Sections

[section_list]

## Featured Content

Check out these highlights:
[featured_items count="3"]
```

### Available Shortcodes

*   **`[latest_posts]`**: Displays a list of the most recent items from a specified section.
    *   `count`: (Optional) Number of items to display (default: 3).
    *   `section`: (Optional) Section key (from `config.yaml`) to pull items from (default: "posts").
*   **`[section_list]`**: Displays a list of links to all content sections defined in `config.yaml`.
    *   `section`: (Optional) If provided, lists items *within* that specific section instead of listing all sections.
*   **`[featured_items]`**: Displays items that have `featured: true` set in their front matter.
    *   `count`: (Optional) Number of items to display (default: 3).
    *   `section`: (Optional) Limit featured items to those within a specific section.

*(Note: More shortcodes might be available or added in the future. Custom shortcodes are also possible.)*
